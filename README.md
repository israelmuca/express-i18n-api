# i18n Express API server

**Validate incoming data, and respond in the user's language**

While there are libraries that help us both translate messages, and validate data in an Express' server, doing both can be a bit tricky.

I created this example based on a project I recently did for an API which had to be fully translated to both English and Spanish.

## Features
- Checks the user's browser language
- Validates that the data is being sent to the API and in the proper format
- Returns either error or success messages in the user's browser language
